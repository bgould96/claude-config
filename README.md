Collection of Claude commands, tools, etc

Intended to be used as the .claude folder of a project, preferably as a submodule for easy config sharing across projects.

```
git submodule add git@github.com:bgould96/claude-config.git .claude
```

With this + a CLAUDE.md in the project repo itself, Claude Code can be trivially deployed anywhere.
